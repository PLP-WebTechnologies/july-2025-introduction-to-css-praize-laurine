            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My learning journey through PLP has been exciting and transformative. I have gained hands-on 
                experience in web development, from building basic HTML structures to applying CSS for beautiful, 
                responsive designs. Each module has challenged me to think critically, experiment with new ideas, and 
                improve my problem-solving skills. This program has not only strengthened my technical abilities but 
                also boosted my confidence as an aspiring software developer.
